  <p>I graduated in law school around 10 years ago and I have been working as a public servant for more than twelve years. Life is good in general, but I don't have the same feeling about my job that I used to have.
    I constantly see myself counting the minutes to end the workday, counting the months to the next vacation and counting the years to retirement. I feel bad about it.</p>
  <p>I don't feel well doing what I do for living anymore. It is just a boring task that I do to get the money I need for living. </p>
  <p>Learning to code brought me back the excitement and the joy to work on something. It may be only a hobby for now, but it is opening my eyes to a new world of possibilities and it makes me feel great.</p>

  <h3>My Interests</h3>
  <ul>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> I love to travel and to learn new languages!
      <ul>
        <li>I have been to Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain, France, Andorra, United States and the Bahamas.</li>
        <li>Most of the time I try to stay in hostels or in local's homes so I can get in touch with people from all over the world.</li>
        <li>I grew up speaking Portuguese. Nowadays I can speak, read and write English and Spanish.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> I love to be outdoors
      <ul>
        <li>I ran two marathons and a dozen half-marathons in my life.</li>
        <li>During four days on an holiday I walked almost 100Km from my home town.</li>
        <li>I did trekking in Patagonia during a week, completing more than 90km between the mountains.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>I read just about everything: my interest in reading is predy wide and goes from philosophy to graphic novels.</li>
        <li>My favourite author is Jos√© Saramago, a Portuguese writer who has won the Nobel prize of literature.</li>
        <li>When it comes to graphic novels I definitely would read again that Sandman saga, from Neil Gaiman, a British fantasy writer.</li>
        <li>The best book I've ever read when I think about philosophy is the Enchiridion of Epictetus. It taught us to make the best of what is in our power, and take the rest as it occurs.</li>
        <li>Justice, from Michael Sandel, is another a good pick to re-read every once in a while.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Coffee ‚òïÔ∏è in the morning is a must for me.</li>
